(1) What is a binary tree?

(Ans) A Binary Tree is a data structure where:
        (a) Each node has at most two children
        (b) The two children are called:
            (i) Left child
            (ii) Right child
        (c) The top node is called Root

(2) Basic Terms 

    (a) Root: The first node of the tree
    (b) Parent: A node that has children
    (c) Child: A node connected below another node
    (d) Leaf:  A node with no children
    (e) Edge: The connection between two nodes
    (f) Height: The maximum distance (number of edges) from the root to a leaf.

(3) Example:

    A
   / \
  B   C

  Here, A is the root
  B and C are children of A
  B and C are leaf nodes

(4) Types of Binary Trees

    (a) Full Binary Tree    
         - Every node has either 0 or 2 children

    (b) Complete Binary Tree
         - All levels are filled except possibly the last
         - The last level is filled from left to right

    (c) Skewed Binary Tree
         - Every node has only one child
         - It looks like a linked list
