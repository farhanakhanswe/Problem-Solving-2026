(1) What is a binary tree?

(Ans) A Binary Tree is a data structure where:
        (a) Each node has at most two children
        (b) The two children are called:
            (i) Left child
            (ii) Right child
        (c) The top node is called Root

(2) Basic Terms 

    (a) Root: The first node of the tree
    (b) Parent: A node that has children
    (c) Child: A node connected below another node
    (d) Leaf:  A node with no children
    (e) Edge: The connection between two nodes
    (f) Height: The maximum distance (number of edges) from the root to a leaf.

(3) Example:

    A
   / \
  B   C

  Here, A is the root
  B and C are children of A
  B and C are leaf nodes

(4) Types of Binary Trees

    (a) Full Binary Tree    
         - Every node has either 0 or 2 children

    (b) Complete Binary Tree
         - All levels are filled except possibly the last
         - The last level is filled from left to right

    (c) Skewed Binary Tree
         - Every node has only one child
         - It looks like a linked list

(5) Code:

    class Node {
        constructor(value) {
            this.value = value;
            this.left = null;
            this.right = null;
        }
    }

    class BinarySearchTree {
        constructor() {
            this.root = null;
        }

        insert(value) {
            const newNode = new Node(value);

            if (this.root === null) {
                this.root = newNode;
                return;
            }

            let current = this.root;

            while (true) {
                if (value < current.value) {
                    if (current.left === null) {
                        current.left = newNode;
                        return;
                    }
                    current = current.left;
                } else {
                    if (current.right === null) {
                        current.right = newNode;
                        return;
                    }
                    current = current.right;
                }
            }
        }
    }
